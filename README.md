# My Website
My website incorporates HTML Activity 1 and 2. It includes multiple stanzas using _br_ and _pre_. Throughout the multiple pages, I applied _b_, _strong_, _em_, _i_, and _span_ on individual words. I was also able to incorporate pictures and borders in my background. The index, about me, and one poem (Fall page) are commented. I also included video of the page working.
